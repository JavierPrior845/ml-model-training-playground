# ML Model Training Playground: Customer Churn Predictor 🚀

## 📌 Overview
This project is part of my professional roadmap to becoming an **AI Software Engineer**. The goal of this repository is to demonstrate the transition from experimental Data Science (Notebooks) to production-ready software (Modular Scripts).

I have built a **Customer Churn Prediction** system that identifies at-risk customers for a telecommunications company, allowing for proactive retention strategies.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.11+
* **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Environment:** Virtualenv / Pip
* **Principles:** Modular Programming, Clean Code, DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
